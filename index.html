                                        The sharp turn of events—the USSR finding itself at war with Germany—is made even more impactful 
                                        by Anderson's intentional focus on how the USSR felt victimized whilst they victimized their own people.

                                        Anderson's satiric exemplification of the atrocities the 
                                        USSR committed not only suggests Anderson has a critical and disgusted attitude, but also 
                                        evokes a yearning for justice from the reader, reminding them of the suffering that the Russian people

                                        Anderson conveys his astonishment by calling this brush with death an "absurdist fable", exaggerating how unbelievable
                                        Shostakovich's luck is, suggesting it is mythical. Anderson builds on this by describing the experience shown with polysyllabic diction,
                                        which results in the audience feel just as equally perplexed as Shostakovich and Anderson, by mirroring the complex web of events that 
                                        resulted in Shostakovich's escape and the text's complexity.

                                            Throughout the book, Anderson establishes Stalin as a symbol of death by using numerous examples of his purge of dissenters. But here, there is a tranquil image of a peaceful family life
                                            being placed right next to it. Anderson does this to foreshadow misfortune for the Shostakovich family. It brews tension and makes the reader feel fearful and anxious.

                                        much like how you would expect Shostakovich's story to have a clear ending. Anderson links the shared idea of resolution by using the term <i>perfect cadence</i>
                                        as a metonym to describe how Shostakovich's life was indeed still not free from the conflicts of his time. In any case, even if the reader does not see the metonym, the reader would feel a foreboding mood&#8212;Anderson makes it clear nonetheless that Shostakovich's life isn't
                                        free of troubles just yet, and only emphasizes this with a metonym.

                                            It is one of the sick ironies of the war that 
                                            they probably would not have been able to if they had not learned to absorb loss in the nightmare of Stalin’s purges. 
                                            ... [Stalin] could plant NKVD gunners behind his 
                                            soldiers and tell them to shoot if anyone showed signs of cowardice. 
                                            He could send battalions of prisoners into battle, marching toward almost certain death. He could relocate 
                                            millions of factory workers by command in the space of a 
                                            few weeks. He could rely on the slave labor of millions in the gulag.
                                            As Sir Alan Brooke has written, 'It was the Russians who provided the oceans of blood necessary to defeat Germany'" (Anderson, "Symphony for the City of the Dead", 353).

                                        Anderson's claim within this passage is that Stalin's regime caused so much suffering that it prepared the Russian people for their fight with the Nazis.
                                        Furthermore, it claims that Stalin's extreme policies helped him win the war, despite the unthinkable amount of lives lost in the process. By specifically showing
                                        examples of Stalin's policies, the reader is convinced that Anderson's assertion is correct&mdash;since the Russian people had grown used to the
                                        horrible conditions of Stalin's regime, they were prepared to do unthinkable things, because to them, they were living a life where such horrifying demands were a fact of life.

                    Anderson's clever word choice and meticulous pacing prevents the novel from <i>ever</i> becoming a drag. 
                    He balances action, suspense and exposition in such a way that you're always looking for what's next.

                <p>
                    No matter what you're looking to get out of this novel, whether it be entertainment or knowledge, Anderson's novel provides both,
                    with drama and nonfiction in equal measure.

                    Structuring this biography as a narrative does wonders for the reader's enjoyment&#8212;and the fact that the events of the 
                    book truly happened makes it all the more enjoyable.

                <p>
                    While Anderson occasionally makes the somewhat obscure allusion, this is <b>never</b> to the detriment of your reading experience.
                    Anderson never relies on devices for explaining his ideas&#8212;rather, he uses them to emphasize his ideas. Either way, Anderson makes sure that
                    his ideas are clearly conveyed.

                    <p class="text-center text-info">Why did Matthew Tobin Anderson write <span style="font-style: italic;">Symphony for the City of the Dead</span>?</p>
                    <p>Let's start by looking at just <b>who</b> M. T. Anderson is.</p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            Anderson usually writes young adult books (Anderson, "About").
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    According to him, he writes more mature themes for a younger audience because
                                    unlike older audiences, they hope for a better world (Anderson, "A Note from Author M. T. Anderson").
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            He was a classical music reviewer once (Anderson, "About").
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                He engaged with classical music before, even as a child. He actually first found Shostakovich's music as an older teenager (Anderson, "A Note from Author M. T. Anderson").
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why was Shostakovich so special to him?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Anderson found a great deal of depth in Shostakovich's music&#8212;his music had intricate layers of complexity 
                        that fascinated Anderson (Anderson, "A Note from Author M. T. Anderson"). 
                        <br/>
                        This was quite like another situation in Anderson's childhood&#8212;he read <i>Hiroshima</i> by John Hersey, which gave him great
                        insight into the moral complexity of war ("A Note from Author M. T. Anderson"). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recall Anderson's familiarity with classical music&#8212;this was key in him having deeper insight into Shostakovich's music.
                        Without this, he wouldn't have taken enough interest to write about Shostakovich's life within the larger historical context of World War II and the rise of communism.
                        Undoubtedly, this inspired Anderson to share his findings and his new perspective on this rather familiar topic.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anderson conveys this quite nicely within the book itself:
                        <blockquote>
                            "History is not simply the great tumults and tragedies but the accumulation of tiny moments and gestures" (Anderson, "Symphony for the City of the Dead", 367).
                        </blockquote>
                    </p>
                    <h4>What does Anderson aim to accomplish with this book?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Anderson was driven by the bizarre and compelling chain of events that established how important Shostakovich's music was in the
                        context of the rise of communism and World War II ("A Note from Author M. T. Anderson"). 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The novel perspective of World War II and communism that can be seen only through looking at Shostakovich's impact on this period inspired Anderson to 
                        write <i>Symphony for the City of the Dead</i> to both honor Shostakovich's legacy and to portray the fascinating history that enthralled him.
                        What's more is, even though he writes for all sorts of people, he had one specific audience in mind as well; and it is deeply linked with what Anderson aims for his book to do.
                    </p>
                    <h5>A specific audience</h5>
                    <p>
                        Anderson wrote with <b>young adults</b> in mind. Why?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anderson did so as a reflection of his own experiences. He knew that this story would be better suited
                        for an audience ready for more mature topics, while young enough to still have aspirations and hopes of a better
                        future, and still feel shock at injustice, much like his experience reading <i>Hiroshima</i>, and even listening
                        to Shostakovich's music. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is Anderson's way of making the world a better place: by informing the youth so that they
                        are aware of historical injustices and cruelties so that they can be avoided in the future.

                                As a nonfiction book, clearly one of the purposes is to inform. 
                                Obviously, one of the messages is the real events 
                                that transpired within the book&#8212;the actual 
                                description of the horrors people experienced during the Siege of Leningrad and the rise of the USSR.

                                    Shostakovich's 7th was key in mustering popular support in America for foreign aid to the USSR, 
                                    which resulted in the tide turning against the Nazis on the battlegrounds.

                                    A key motif in Anderson's novel is how common people work together in small ways to face the overwhelming challenges of life during the Siege of Leningrad.
                                    Whether it was civilian volunteering for production or infrastructure, or performing and writing music, all of it was essential to
                                    stop the starvation and the senseless murder.

                                <p>Given how Anderson aims to encourage positive change and discourage injustice, especially from one of his target audiences, young adults, 
                                    it makes sense to suggest this message, because if Anderson appeals to an audience who isn't jaded over injustice yet, he must encourage them to believe in their power to make a difference. </p>

                            <i>Symphony for the City of the Dead: Dmitri Shostakovich and the Siege of Leningrad</i> was published in 2015, 
                            far after the events described in the book. However, these historical events were so impactful to all of history that
                            they certainly did play a part in shaping this book.
                        </p>
                        <p>Let's look at some of them.</p>
                        <h3>Communism</h3>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>
                                Even today, communism's feasibility is debated by many.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Anderson does not make a specific argument to this end, 
                                        but still condemns the atrocities committed by each of the dictators 
                                        in the USSR's era.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Writing about the intricacies of economic systems wouldn't make sense for this book anyway.
                                        Anderson's motivation for writing the book was to explore Shostakovich's impact on the period, and as an effect
                                        his book contextualizes this period of time.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Furthermore, for Anderson's purpose, critiquing an economic system is irrelevant; however, he critiques the atrocities committed in
                                        the time period of the book&mdash;no matter who is responsible. This matches with the book's purpose of shaping the world such that these
                                        atrocities never happen again. However, he does not censor the relationship between the political ideologies of that time and the atrocities that happened.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>World War II</h3>
                        <p>
                            World War II is a very familiar time period in history&mdash;it was still within modern history, 
                            and it's impact was so profound that it is one of the most deeply studied events in history.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            However, most people study the political and military aspects of World War II. <i>Who would have thought that classical music would have to do with any of this?</i>
                            Anderson notes difficulty in researching Shostakovich's life (Anderson, "Symphony for the City of the Dead", 368). However, if his motivation for writing the book was strong enough
                            to look for the facts even with relatively few leads, the thrill of exploring a new aspect of a familiar time period would certainly be something that would further motivate Anderson and
                            is why Anderson's novel focuses on both Shostakovich's music <b>and</b> it's impact.

                <p>
                    We've talked quite a bit about how Shostakovich's music was so impactful. <i>Why not listen to it?</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here, you can listen to the Shostakovich's 7th Symphony itself, the <i>Chekhov's gun</i> of this novel.
                    This rendition was played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, directed by Valery Gergiev at the Orquesta y Coros del Mariinsky Theatre.
