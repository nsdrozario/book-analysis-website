                                        The sharp turn of events—the USSR finding itself at war with Germany—is made even more impactful 
                                        by Anderson's intentional focus on how the USSR felt victimized whilst they victimized their own people.

                                        Anderson's attitude is clear -- his satiric exemplification of the atrocities the 
                                        USSR committed evokes a yearning for justice from the reader, reminding them of the suffering that the Russian people
                                        have endured.

                                            Shostakovich and his pregnant physicist were delighted to move out of his childhood home.

                                        Throughout the book, Anderson establishes Stalin as a symbol of death by using numerous examples of his purge of dissenters. But here, there is a tranquil image of a peaceful family life
                                        being placed right next to it. Anderson does this to foreshadow misfortune for the Shostakovich family. It brews tension and makes the reader feel fearful and anxious.

                                        Anderson cleverly juxtaposed these scenes to keep the reader immersed into the story, tapping into the reader's curiosity and fear of Shostakovich, the protagoanist, from falling into the clutches of evil.

                    <p class="text-center text-info">Why did Matthew Tobin Anderson write <span style="font-style: italic;">Symphony for the City of the Dead</span>?</p>
                    <p>Let's start by looking at just <b>who</b> M. T. Anderson is.</p>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            Anderson usually writes young adult books.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            He was a classical music reviewer once.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                He engaged with classical music before, even as a child. He actually first found Shostakovich's music as an older teenager.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Why was Shostakovich so special to him?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Anderson found a great deal of depth in Shostakovich's music -- his music had intricate layers of complexity 
                        that fascinated Anderson. This was quite like another situation in Anderson's childhood -- he read <i>Hiroshima</i> by John Hersey, which gave him great
                        insight into the moral complexity of war.
                    </p>
                    <h4>What does Anderson aim to accomplish with this book?</h4>
                    <p>
                        Anderson was driven by the bizarre and compelling chain of events that established how important Shostakovich's music was in the
                        context of the rise of communism and World War II. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, seeing how rare discourse was about the state of Russia during World War II, he sought to 
                        write <i>Symphony for the City of the Dead</i> to both honor Shostakovich's legacy and to portray the fascinating history that enthralled him.
                        What's more is, even though he writes for all sorts of people, he had one specific audience in mind as well...
                    </p>
                    <h5>A specific audience</h5>
                    <p>
                        Anderson wrote with <b>young adults</b> in mind. Why?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anderson did so as a reflection of his own experiences. He knew that this story would be better suited
                        for an audience ready for more mature topics, while young enough to still have aspirations and hopes of a better
                        future, and still feel shock at injustice, much like his expereince reading <i>Hiroshima</i>, and even listening
                        to Shostakovich's music. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is Anderson's way of making the world a better place: by informing the youth so that they
                        are aware of historical injustices and cruelties so that they can be avoided in the future.
                    </p>
                    <!--
                    <p>Anderson was a classical music reviewer and has a deep passion for classical music. 
                        Anderson discovering the profound, unprecedented historical impact of Shostakovich's music, much like the moving nature of Shostakovich's symphonies themselves, wanted to share
                        this unknown and surprising depth behind the events of the formation of the USSR and the outbreak of World War II.

                            <i>Symphony for the City of the Dead: Dmitri Shostakovich and the Siege of Leningrad</i> was published in 2015, 
                            far after the events described in the book. However, these historical events were so impactful to all of history that
                            they certainly did play a part in shaping this book.
                        </p>
                        <p>Let's look at some of them.</p>
                        <h3>Communism</h3>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>
                                Even today, communism's feasibility is debated by many.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        Anderson does not make a specific argument to this end, 
                                        but still condemns the atrocities commited by each of the dictators 
                                        in the USSR's era.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Anderson does not aim to make the book's message
                                        about economic systems; the book is written
                                        primarily from the perspective of the common people and their struggles, rather than debating
                                        economics.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Writing about the intricacies of economic systems wouldn't make sense for this book anyway. Anderson wrote
                                        this book not because of communism itself, but because of how it impacted Shostakovich (and by extension, the common person in Russia at the time.)
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>World War II</h3>
                        <ul class="list">
                            <li>World War II is </li>

                    We've talked quite a bit about how Shostakovich's music was so impactful. <i>Why not listen to it?</i>

                <p>
                    Here, you can listen to the Shostakovich's 7th Symphony itself, the <i>Chekhov's gun</i> of this novel.
                    This rendition was played by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, directed by Valery Gergiev at the Orquesta y Coros del Mariinsky Theatre.
